/**
 * gardenerNavRegistry — Single source of truth for Gardener Console navigation and documentation.
 *
 * WHAT: Central registry of every Gardener Console section with route, zone, description, and How-To content.
 * WHERE: Consumed by OperatorHowToPage (documentation), sidebar (navigation), and zone registry (enforcement).
 * WHY: Adding a nav item here automatically creates a How-To stub — no manual sync needed.
 *
 * TO ADD A NEW SECTION:
 * 1. Add an entry to GARDENER_NAV_REGISTRY below
 * 2. Specify route, zone, icon key, and at minimum: title + summary
 * 3. The How-To page will automatically render a card (with "Documentation pending" if whatYouSee/whatToDo are empty)
 * 4. The zone registry will auto-validate against this list in dev mode
