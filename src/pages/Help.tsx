    title: 'Platform Overview',
    description: `How ${brand.appName}™ supports relationship-building across communities.`,
    content: `${brand.appName}™ is built for community-centered organizations — people who spend their days building genuine partnerships. It is not a sales CRM. It is a relationship memory system, powered by ${brand.assistantFullName}.

The platform rests on three pillars:

## Relationship Memory

Every conversation, reflection, event, and campaign touch becomes part of a living story for each partnership. ${brand.appName}™ remembers so you can focus on the relationship, not the record-keeping.

- **Reflections** capture your observations after meetings, calls, and events — private by default, team-visible when you choose
- **Gmail integration** quietly records sent emails and campaign touches as part of the relationship timeline
- **Story Chapters** organize the relationship narrative into human themes (How we connected, The conversation, What we've shared)
- **Task suggestions** from your sent emails surface commitments you made, so nothing falls through the cracks

## Community Awareness (${modules.civitas.label})

${brand.appName}™ watches the communities where you work — not with urgency, but with curiosity.

- **Local Pulse** discovers events happening near your Home Metro every Monday, including RSS feeds, calendar sources, and web pages you add
- **Metro Narratives** blend community news with your partnership data to tell the story of each city
- **Drift Detection** tracks how community themes shift week over week across all your metros
- **Neighborhood Insights** provide census and historical context for the places where your partners operate

## Narrative Relational Intelligence (${brand.assistantName}™)

Rather than dashboards full of numbers, ${brand.appName}™ builds stories from data:

- **Human Impact Reports** present your work as a mission narrative for board meetings
- **Journey Chapters** track partnership progression using human language (Found → First Conversation → Discovery → Growing Together)
- **Momentum & Heat Maps** celebrate community engagement without ranking or evaluating anyone
- **Story Suggestions** match community themes with organization profiles to suggest natural check-ins

---

    description: 'Your daily starting point — context, not pressure.',
    content: `The Command Center is where your day begins. It is designed to offer clarity, not urgency — showing you what matters most without telling you what to do.

**Two Views:**

**Operational View**
The detail-dense view for when you need specifics: focus items, stale next steps, email suggestions, and quick action cards. Everything you need to plan your week.

**Human Overview**
A calmer, story-first view that highlights relationship momentum, community signals, and gentle suggestions. Designed for days when you want the big picture, not the task list.

**Key Features:**

**Relationship Suggestions**
- Suggestions from your sent emails ("From Your Sent Emails") — commitments you made, surfaced for follow-through
- Follow-up suggestions based on reply patterns, watchlist signals, and event imports
- Accept to create a task or draft campaign, Dismiss to remove, or click through for context

**Weekly AI Focus Plan**
- 5-10 prioritized actions for the week, scored by overdue items, grant deadlines, near-win partnerships, and inactive relationships
- Focus Mode (Mon-Thu) for action, Review Mode (Fri-Sun) for reflection
- Mark items done as you complete them — progress persists all week

**Next Best Actions**
- Evidence-based recommendations ranked by signal strength and predicted success
- Execute, Dismiss (suppresses 30 days), or Snooze

**Community Signals**
- Metro momentum indicators and narrative drift alerts
- Local Pulse highlights from your Home Metro
- Watchlist signals from partner website changes

**Tips:**
- Switch between Operational and Human Overview using the mode toggle
- The Command Center adapts to your day — it never demands action`

**Four Dimensions:**
- **Care**: Activities, visits, provisions, and volunteer hours — how you're showing up
- **Presence**: Events attended, local pulse engagement, community visibility
- **Relationships**: Partner journey movement, new contacts, deepening connections
- **Narrative**: Reflections written, story threads formed, seasonal echoes detected

**Territory-Aware:**
All metrics are scoped to your activated territories. Filter by metro, county, state, or country to see movement in specific areas.

**Time Windows:**
Switch between 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day views to see momentum trends.

**Tips:**
- Movement Intelligence replaces traditional analytics dashboards with human-centered awareness
- Check weekly for a gentle sense of where energy is flowing

- **The Impact**: What you've done together — provisions, grants, reflections on shared work
- **The Next Move**: Gentle guidance — suggested actions, outreach drafts, follow-up recommendations
- **Admin** (role-gated): Technical diagnostics visible only to admins and leadership

**Journey Chapters:**
Partnership progression uses human language instead of sales stages:
- Found → First Conversation → Discovery → Pricing Shared → Account Setup → First Devices → Growing Together
- "Not the Right Time" replaces "Closed - Not a Fit"

**Enrichment:**

**Campaign Workflow:**
1. Create a new campaign with subject and email body
2. Build your audience using filters (metros, stages, partner tiers)
3. Add individual contacts or import from opportunity filters
4. Review audience list and preview recipient count
5. Send test email to yourself, then send the full campaign

**Audience Building:**
- **Opportunity Filters**: Target by stage, partner tier, mission snapshot, metro
- **Organization People**: All contacts linked to matching opportunities
- **Manual Entry**: Add individual email addresses directly
- Recipients are snapshotted at build time (list won't change during send)

**Personalization Tags:**
Use merge tags in your email body for personalized content:
- \`{{ contact.FIRSTNAME }}\` → First name
- \`{{ contact.LASTNAME }}\` → Last name
- \`{{ contact.FULLNAME }}\` → Full name
- \`{{ contact.EMAIL }}\` → Recipient's email address

**Find People** (/people/find)
Search for staff, leadership, and team members at target organizations with intent-enforced queries and role focus biasing.

**Find Events** (/events/find)
Discover conferences, summits, webinars, and community events with ticketing/commerce suppression.

**Find Grants** (/grants/find)
Find grant opportunities, RFPs, and funding sources with course/template blocking.

**Territory-Aware Scoring:**
Results are scored by proximity to your activated territories:
- Metro organizations score highest (1.0)
- County results score 0.85 (fair rural weighting)
- State-level results score 0.7
- Results outside your territories appear in an "Explore beyond" section

**How Search Works:**
1. Enter your query — the system appends required intent keywords automatically
2. Results are scoped to your activated territories by default
3. Micro-Crawl: top 5 URLs are scraped for deeper extraction
4. LLM extracts structured results from the crawled content

**Saved Searches:**
- Save any search for re-running later
- "New result" highlighting — URLs are deduplicated across runs
- Private to the creator (per-user RLS)

**What Feeds the Story:**
- **Reflections**: Your observations after meetings, calls, and visits — the richest source of relationship memory
- **Email History**: Sent emails are quietly recorded as touchpoints
- **Campaign Touches**: When a campaign email reaches this partner, it becomes part of the story
- **Event Reflections**: When you mark an event as attended and write a reflection, that moment enters the story
- **Tasks from Emails**: Commitments you made in sent emails are surfaced as task suggestions

**Story Chapters:**
- "How we connected" — the earliest recorded interaction
- "The conversation" — email exchanges and ongoing dialogue
- "What we've shared" — campaigns and outreach efforts
- "Reflections along the way" — your personal observations over time

**Privacy:**
- Your reflections are never quoted verbatim in shared narratives
- Only extracted topics and themes are used by AI systems
- Email bodies are never injected into metro narratives or reports

3. Promising results are scraped by Firecrawl for deeper extraction (dates, locations, details)

**Keyword Tuner:**
Your discovery is driven by keywords you control:
- **Global baseline**: Standard nonprofit/community terms (always included)
- **Archetype keywords**: Terms specific to your mission type (e.g., "digital inclusion" for tech nonprofits)
- **Enriched keywords**: Automatically extracted from your organization's website
- **Your keywords**: Terms you add manually via the inline Keyword Tuner (up to 20)

**Event States:**
- **Confirmed**: Date and details verified
- **Awaiting AI parsing**: Discovered but still being enriched — visible in your Pulse
- **Low confidence date**: Date extracted but uncertain — flagged for your review

**Running Pulse:**
- Scheduled runs happen automatically for your metro
- Manual "Run Pulse" button available in Gardener Settings (CRESCERE zone)
- Long-tail refresh includes stable recurring services (annual programs, ongoing classes)

**Project Types:**
Projects can be categorized by type to help with year-end reporting and narrative storytelling. Types vary by organization archetype:

- **Direct Service**: Home Repair, Food/Clothing Drive, Meal Delivery, Transportation Assistance
- **Community Care**: Neighborhood Cleanup, Community Garden, Holiday Gift Drive, Back-to-School Event
- **Education & Empowerment**: Tutoring/Mentoring, Literacy Workshop, Financial Literacy, Job Readiness Training
- **Shelter & Housing**: Shelter Night, Furniture Setup, Welcome Kit Assembly, Housing Navigation
- **Spiritual & Pastoral**: Hospital/Care Facility Visit, Grief Support Group, Prayer Walk, Mission Trip
- **Advocacy & Outreach**: Voter Registration Drive, Listening Session, Resource Fair, Community Forum

**How It Works:**
1. Create a project with a title, date, and optional location
2. Add helpers (volunteers and staff) as participants
3. Record reflections and voice notes as the work unfolds
4. Optionally log impact — people helped, attendance count, and outcome notes

**Impact Tracking:**
Each project includes a calm, optional impact snapshot:
- **People Helped**: How many community members were served
- **Attendance Count**: How many helpers participated
- **Outcome Note**: A brief narrative of what happened and what it meant

**Downstream Signals:**
- Projects feed into **Narrative Threads** as weekly story chapters
- Impact data flows into **Testimonium** rollups for year-end reporting
- Story density (notes per project) is tracked to encourage reflection capture
- If Communio is enabled, anonymized aggregate signals are shared across the network

**Tips:**
- Projects are not project management — they're story containers for good work
- Voice notes captured during a project become part of the project's narrative
- Even a brief outcome note makes your year-end reporting dramatically richer

## How to Enable

Open your user menu (top-right avatar) and toggle **Accessibility Mode**. Your preference is saved automatically and persists across sessions.

## What Changes

**Visual:**
- High-contrast dark theme with 4.5:1+ contrast ratios on all text
- Enhanced focus rings (3px solid yellow) on every interactive element
- Links are always underlined — never relying on color alone
- Badges and status indicators gain visible borders
- Cards and sections have increased spacing for readability

**Motion:**
- All animations and transitions are suppressed instantly
- This also respects the browser's prefers-reduced-motion setting independently

**Touch & Click:**
- Minimum 44×44px touch targets on all buttons and controls
- Voice input button grows to 48×48px in a11y mode

**Typography:**
- Base font size increases to 16px minimum
- Line height increases to 1.6 for readability
- Letter spacing increased to 0.04em
- Small text (10px, 12px) is bumped to readable sizes

**Keyboard:**
- "Skip to main content" link appears on Tab focus (WCAG 2.4.1)
- Full keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
- Escape closes modals and drawers

## NRI Companion Accessibility

The CROS Companion (Compass) is designed to be the primary interaction surface for accessibility users:

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Arrow keys navigate between nudge cards and quick prompts
- Tab moves through all interactive elements within the drawer
- Enter activates buttons and prompts
- Escape closes the Compass

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Chat history uses role="log" for proper screen reader context
- New NRI responses are announced via aria-live regions
- Nudge count is announced when the Compass opens
- Each message bubble is labelled as "You said" or "NRI responded"
- Loading state announces "NRI is composing a response…"

**Voice Input:**
- Click the microphone button to speak your message instead of typing
- Screen readers announce "Listening for your voice…" when active
- Captured text is announced before sending
- Error states are clearly announced if voice capture fails

**Simplified Responses:**
- When Accessibility Mode is active, NRI adjusts its communication style
- Responses use bullet points instead of prose paragraphs
- Sentences are shorter (max ~15 words each)
- No decorative emoji — only functional indicators (📋 queued, ✅ immediate)
- Numbered lists when offering multiple options
- Clear "Next step:" labels for action items

## Tips

- The Compass auto-focuses the text input when opened — start typing immediately
- Use voice input for longer messages or when typing is difficult
- Quick prompts are navigable with arrow keys — press Enter to send
- All nudge signals include descriptive aria-labels with direction and content`

                  <p>
                    Many actions can be undone immediately using the undo toast that appears after deletions.
                    The window is brief — act while it's still visible.

                  <p>
                    Deleted records (Partners, People, Events, Volunteers, Grants) are kept safely for 90 days.
                    You can restore them from the Recycle Bin in your activity feed, or ask the NRI assistant.

                  <p>
                    If something disappears and you can't find it, open the NRI assistant and say
                    "I accidentally deleted something." The assistant will review your recent actions
                    and offer to restore or open an emergency recovery request.

                  <p>
                    CROS keeps a small, private breadcrumb trail of <em>actions</em> (not content) —
                    like "you deleted a Partner" or "you published an essay." This helps the assistant
                    guide you to the right fix. No notes, emails, names, or personal content are ever stored.

                <div>
                  <h4 className="text-sm font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Restoration Narrative</h4>
                  <p>
                    When something is restored, it quietly becomes part of the story. Restoration moments
                    appear as soft golden threads in the Gardener's view — a reminder that care remembered
                    is care continued.

                    Tenants can disable the recent-actions feature in Settings → Privacy.
                    This removes the assistant's ability to see recent actions, but restore
                    and recycle bin features remain available.
