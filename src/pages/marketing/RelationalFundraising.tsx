            <p>
              Most nonprofit technology begins with money. How much was given. When. By whom. What campaign triggered it. The entire architecture is designed around the transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              But generosity doesn't begin with a transaction. It begins with trust. With presence. With someone showing up — again and again — until a relationship forms that makes giving feel natural, not extracted.
            </p>
            <p>
              CROS was built on a different premise: <strong className="text-[hsl(var(--marketing-navy))]">if you remember the people, the generosity follows.</strong> Not because you tracked it. Because you earned it.

              CROS includes <strong className="text-[hsl(var(--marketing-navy))]">basic generosity records</strong> — date, amount, whether it's recurring, and a personal note. These records live on a person's profile as relational context, not as financial data to manage.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not donor management. There are no campaigns, pledge tracking, tax receipts, donor scores, or fundraising thermometers. Generosity data never influences how NRI™ prioritizes people or relationships — that boundary is architecturally enforced.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead, CROS gives you <strong className="text-[hsl(var(--marketing-navy))]">relationship memory</strong>. Every reflection, every event attended, every conversation captured becomes part of a living narrative — and generosity is simply one thread in that story.
