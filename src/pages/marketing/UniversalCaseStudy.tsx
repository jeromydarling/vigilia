                For many years, I had the unexpected privilege of portraying Pier Giorgio Frassati in a theatrical production about his life.
              </p>
              <p>What began as a role slowly became something else.</p>
              <p>
                To step into his story night after night was to inhabit his rhythm — the joy, the urgency, the hidden discipline of remembering people. I had to study the notebooks. The follow-through. The way he moved through a room. The way he carried names.
              </p>
              <p>And something shifted.</p>
              <p>
                I began to see how much of relational work is lost — not because people don't care, but because we forget. We get busy. We move on. We don't have a structure strong enough to hold what matters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pier Giorgio's life revealed something deeply practical: love at scale requires discipline.
              </p>
              <p>CROS™ was born from that realization.</p>
              <p className="whitespace-pre-line">
                {'Not to digitize a saint.\nNot to romanticize service.\nBut to build a structure that supports the kind of remembering he practiced naturally.'}
              </p>
              <p>
                If CROS™ works, it works because it is rooted in a life that proved remembering people changes everything.
